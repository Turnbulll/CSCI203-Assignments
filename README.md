# CSCI203-Assignments
Assignments from Algorithms and Data Structures (CSCI203)

A1 - 
1. Read the name of the text file from the console. 
2. Read in a text file, not all at once. (This can be line by line, word by word or character by character.) 
3. The file content must be converted to a sequence of words, discarding punctuation and folding all letters into lower case.
4. Store the unique words and maintain a count of each different word. 
5. The words should be ordered by decreasing count and, if there are multiple words with the same count, alphabetically. (This ordering may be achieved as the words are read in, partially as the words are read or at the end of all input processing.)
6. Output the total number of words and the number of “unique words” 
7. Output the first fifteen words in the sorted list, along with their counts. 
8. Output the last fifteen words in the list, along with their counts.

A2 -
1. first read in the number of servers or tellers for the simulation, 
2. read in a file name from standard input and then open this file, 
3. read data record by record from the named file, 
4. perform the simulation according to the input records, and 
5. output the statistics of the services as specified below.

Output to standard output for each run will consist of the following data: 
• Number of people served. 
• Time last service request is completed. 
• Average total service time per customer (this includes the time spent in a queue). 
• Average total time in service per customer (this excludes the time spent in a queue) 
• Average length of the queue (this can be estimated as the ratio between total queuing time and the time last service request is completed)
• Maximum length, i.e. number of customers, of the queue. 
• Total idle time for each server.

A3 - 
1. Read the name of a text file from the console. (Not the command line) 
2. Read an undirected weighted graph from the file. 
3. Find the shortest path between the start and goal vertices specified in the file. 
4. Print out the vertices on the shortest path, in order from start to goal. 
5. Print out the length of the shortest path. 6. Find the second shortest path between the start and goal vertices. 
7. Print out the vertices on the second shortest path, in order from start to goal. 
8. Print out the length of the second shortest path.
